I am passionate about creating learning experiences that change how learners perform their roles. I began my career developing eLearning that learners actually enjoy & designing simulations that expand critical thinking. Now, I help organizations with identifying how training can support their goals, ensuring their programs run smoothly, and measuring the impact of training in the workplace. 

Outside of work, I spend lots of time with my two kiddos, read about emerging technology, and enjoy drinking coffee and sketching alongside my adorable orange kitty, Schrodinger.
